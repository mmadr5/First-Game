The game camera is a 3rd person view of BB8 and they can shoot peanuts and objects. In this case,
5 fruits, the peanuts destroy the fruits but let's the peanuts bounce off with physics and award points,
I have textures for the road, cement and, billboard. I have more than 3 3D models such as bilboard, BB8,
and the towers plus more.

PhotoShop was used to create 2D Textures such as RoadTexture

Blender was used to make the walls and two towers and billboard

I used Low Poly Fruit Pickups, Street Lamps 2, ToonShader from the assets store.

Scripts used for mouse movement from UNITY docs 3D

Cell shader I made via youtube tutorials
